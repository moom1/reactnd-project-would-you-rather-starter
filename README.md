# Would you rather Project

This is my final take on the Would you rather project. I forked the repo and worked my way from the static page. This project is the second submition of Udacity's react nanodegree.Some css files were used from the twitter clone project. Note that the console shows one warning: SharedArrayBuffer will require cross-origin isolation as of M91, around May 2021. Not sure how to remove it.

installation is as simple as npm i => npm start.
